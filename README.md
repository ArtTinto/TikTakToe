# TikTakToe
A TikTakToe made in java, in terminal, all in one Class

This code is made in my beggining in programming, may be some poor translations in variables names, or poor solutions for easy problems
Therefore im very proud about it

This code ,for reasons mentioned previously, may has some bugs or poor solutions, such as:

1 - The player will always be X and the cpu always be O
2 - The code check a lot of times the matriz and i don't know has a better option
3 - Dind't test sufficiently to see if has more bugs
4 - You can only play with CPU but can't play with other person

For good parts this code put some things like check if has possibility of winning or blockling the player of winning,
that can be a lot of useful
